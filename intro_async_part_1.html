<!-- notes on async part 1 
asynchronous programming allows the your program to star ta long task ad still be responsive to other tasks  
while it runs rather than having to wait them use the data when the long task is done
it seems for most modern webpage functions that asynchronous programming is the best idea 
and it would be rare cases that synchronous would work better simply due to the 
consumer want for immediate gratification and not wanting to sit an wait. however for short quick task synchronous still seems useful
from the reading it looks like continued call backs and nesting them can lead to issues  including call back hell and using promises 
which will be discussed later is a way to avoid that-->
